# THE WAY JAVA WORKS
The goal is to write one application and have it work on whatever device your friends have.
1. Source: Create a source document. Use an established protocol (in this case, the Java language).
2. Compiler: Run your document through a source code compiler. The complier checks for errors and won't let you compile until it's satisfied the everything will run correctly.
3. Output: Ther cpompiler creates a new document, coded into Java bytecode. The compiled bytecode is platform-independent.
4. Virtual Machines: Java Virtual machine (JVM), implemented in software, running inside their electronic gadgets. When your friends run your program, the virtual machine reads and runs the bytecode.
