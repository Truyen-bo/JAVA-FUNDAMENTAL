# THE WAY JAVA WORKS
The goal is to write one application and have it work on whatever device your friends have.

1. Source: Create a source document. Use an established protocol (in this case, the Java language).
2. Compiler: Run your document through a source code compiler. The complier checks for errors and won't let you compile until it's satisfied the everything will run correctly.
3. Output: Ther cpompiler creates a new document, coded into Java bytecode. The compiled bytecode is platform-independent.
4. Virtual Machines: Java Virtual machine (JVM), implemented in software, running inside their electronic gadgets. When your friends run your program, the virtual machine reads and runs the bytecode.
# What you'll do in Java
You'll type a source code file, compile it using the javac compiler, and then run the compiled bytecode on a Java virtual machine.

# Speed and memory usage
When Java was first released, it was slow. But soon after, the HotSpot VM was created, as were other performance enhancers. While its's true that Java isn't the fastest language out therr, it's considered to be a very fast languge - almost as fast as languages like C and Rust, and much faster than most other languages out therr.
Java has a magic super-power -- the JVM. The JVM can optimizr your code while it's running, so it's possible to create very fast applications without having to specialized high-performance code.
But full disclosure compared to C and Rust, Java uses a lot of memory
